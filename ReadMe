An unfinished project that will likely be un-necessary once more durable vaccines get approved. 

However if it helps you, extract the archive and run the KoronaKronometre.exe file to access the main menu,
or run individual timers if you wish to skip that entirely. All Timers run independently from the main
interface in case you want to close the Main, run a single timer overnight, cut down on tray icons etc.

Before using, replace the file CO19CON.doc located in the folder KRNDAQ\TMPLT\ with your local 
version of an auth form saved by the same name in a .doc (not docx libdoc oodoc etc) or else 
you might be sending customers to a retailer in the behave state.

Message me at nathanostvig@xmission.com with issues, suggestions or src requests (if you want to see some really sloppy and 
embarassing first time script that is).

Known Issues
=====================================
1) Depending on your machine/graphics sometimes the timer window doesnt go invisible and will 
   appear to blink in a staggered manner, this usually smooths out after a minute or two of 
   running, if it bothers you, there is always the option to hide the timer overlay or not run it
   at all and just print the corresponding time sheet.

2) Time sheets do not print properly on Windows 7 and lower, they will print, but you might have
   to add some line breaks manually. As of current testing it will always print evenly on 8 and above.
   
3) When a timer turns on and off, the timer always starts at the top of the minute. Due to the nature 
   of the way the clock is written it will only ever be a maximum of 1 minute off. This is because the 
   script reads how many minutes remain rather than seconds or milliseconds, for all intents and purposes,
   this quantity seemed negligible, since most reports seem to show timing for actual thaw of vials to be
   a give or take anywhere between 15 minutes and an hour, it might eventually be corrected, but for 
   now, time range is well within reason.

4) Due to the language it was written in, sometimes it is detected as viral/malware. This app is not. It was
   written in a common scripting language, it does what you tell it to, and I've told it to make a timer and 
   nothing else, because it is a very easy language to script, some people have unfortunately abused this power
   and anything written in AHK is sometimes labeled by less complex scanners as malware.

5) If you're running it under WINE on linux/Mac you are going to have a hard time making the window not force itself to
   the top, this is just a translation issue I will likely not be able to change. Furthermore, what healthcare provider
   do you work for that lets you use Linux/Mac and are they hiring?
